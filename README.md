# NYC-taxi-fare
In this repository, I will upload the kernel we used for the Kaggle competition 'NYC taxi fare prediction', which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction). For this, we performed

1. Data cleansing
2. Feature engineering
3. Univariate and bivariate analysis
4. Fit of a linear regression model
5. Fit of a random forest regressor
6. Prediction and submission of the results.

We obtained competitive results which placed us in the first third of the leaderboard table.
